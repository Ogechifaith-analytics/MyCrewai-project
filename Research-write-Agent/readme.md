## Overview
The Research Write Agent leverages the CrewAI framework to create a multi-agent system that streamlines content planning and editing. The system involves three primary agents:
- **Content Planner:** Develops a content strategy and outlines based on the provided topic.
- **Content Writer:** Drafts a blog post using the plan (agent defined externally as `writer`).
- **Editor:** Reviews and refines the blog post to ensure clarity, correct grammar, and adherence to brand guidelines.

This project automates the transformation of raw research into structured, publication-ready content.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Orchestrates different agents to perform specialized tasks in the content creation workflow.
- **Automated Content Planning:** Uses NLP and AI to gather information, generate content outlines, and recommend SEO keywords.
- **Content Generation & Editing:** Integrates automated writing with human-like editing to ensure high-quality output.
- **Python & CrewAI Integration:** Demonstrates advanced usage of Python with the CrewAI framework for task delegation and coordination.
- **Scalability & Flexibility:** Easily extendable to additional tasks or integrated with other content generation pipelines.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Primary programming language for building and executing the project.
- **CrewAI:** Framework for managing multi-agent workflows and delegating tasks.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Techniques used to analyze and generate content.
- **Automation:** Tools and libraries for streamlining content planning and editing.

## Step-by-Step Approach

### 1. Define the Agents
Each agent is set up with a specific role, goal, and backstory.

### 2. Assign Tasks
Each task gives descriptions of goal and what expected output should look like.

### 3. Create the crew
The Crew groups the agents and tasks, executing the entire content creation process.

The final result is rendered in markdown format in the notebook, showcasing the end-to-end automated content creation process.

## Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/Ogechifaith-analytics/research-write-agent.git

cd research-write-agent

**Set Up a Virtual Environment:**

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install Dependencies: Create a requirements.txt (if not already present) that includes:

crewai,
ipython

Then install:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Configure (if necessary):
Set up any environment variables or API keys required by CrewAI or other libraries.

Run the Main Script:

python main.py

The script will execute the multi-agent workflow, and the final output will be displayed in markdown format.

## Future Enhancements
- Extended Agent Capabilities: Add additional agents for tasks like fact-checking or SEO optimization.

- Advanced NLP Integration: Incorporate more sophisticated NLP models for deeper content analysis.
- User Interface: Develop a web-based interface for real-time interaction with the agent system.
  
- Performance Improvements: Optimize the workflow for faster execution and scalability.
